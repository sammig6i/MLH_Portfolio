    <p>
      <span class="initial-letter">I</span> am an upcoming senior CS student at
      WGU, set to graduate in June 2025, and currently working as a DevOps
      Fellow with MLH x Meta. With a background in accounting, I've transitioned
      into the tech industry to pursue my passion for technology. I aim to
      leverage my diverse experiences to make a global impact in technology. In
      my free time, you'll see me cooking, making music, playing basketball, or
      hiking and reading.
